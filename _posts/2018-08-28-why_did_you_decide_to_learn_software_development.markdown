I'm 40 years old with a good job in a dead-end career. Growing up I took C++ classes as a kid, coded simple programs transcribed from STart Magazine on the Atari ST. My path took me to art and I attended Rhode Island School of Design for photography and have worked as an arts instructor, prop designer, photo editor and graphic designer in the years since graduating.

I have always built simple sites for fun, from scratch or with Wordpress as needed. Occasionally I'll look up some jquery to accomplish an idea I have. 

Basically learning these skills and lassoing them to my current abilities seems like the clearest path foward professionally.
